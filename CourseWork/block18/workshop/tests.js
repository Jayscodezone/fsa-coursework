//Expect [action] to be [some result]
//Example: For the prompt "A function called "addition" that returns the sum of two input integers", your tests might include:
//Expect addition(2, 3) to be a number
//Expect addition(2, 3) to be equal to 5
//Expect addition("a", 3) to be an error


// Unit Test input numbers
const multiply =(x,y) =>{
    const product = x * y;
    return product;
}
    multiply(3,9);
//Test cases
//Expect multiply to return the  product of (x,y)
//Expect multiply to return  a number 
//Expect multiply (3,9) to be equal to 27
//Expect multiply("a", 3) to be an error

// Unit Test two arrays 

//const concatOdds (array1, array2);
 //const catOdds ([3,2,1], [9,1,1,1,4,15,-1]){
   //return catOdds [-1,1,3,9,15];
 //}
 
// Expect the function concatOdds take two array integers 
//Expect the  return to be a  a single array of odd numbers in ascending order. 
//Expect if unexpected input number is not in the array then to result in an error
// Expect all the numbers in the result of the array to have no repetition of the numbers.
//Expect with using an array numbers cannot include a zero number between -1 and 1. 
//Expect results of the array to only be odd numbers. 

// Functional Test
// Expect the user to check out as either a guest or a signed in user account 
//Expect the guest user to have an ability to create a login account 
// Expect the shopping cart to have products for purchase before having the action to checkout 
// Expect the action after the completion of the purchase the screen will sent to the payment website
//Expect the payment for product purchases to be Visa, Paypal, or Affirm 
//Expect the completion of payment to route to the review summary page for the purchase 
// Expect if there is failure in payment that the payment page request another method of payment 
// Expect if there is a network error the shopping cart will reserve the items for purchase 
// Expect if there is an expired session to prompt users to login to their account
